For my performance, I used a dawless setup consisting of an Elektron Syntakt 12 track mono-synth and a Digitone FM 4 track poly-synth. I ran the Digitone into the Syntakt's inputs to make use of it's analog fx track and to fade in a new track with the digitone master gain.

The data structure of both devices can be described as Project>Songs>Patterns>Tracks>Sounds.
With the recent addition of songmode, I could easily queue songs/patterns and jump in and out of prerecorded sequences, which gave me the mix of structure and improvisation that I was looking for.
However, as of now, it is not possible to to preassign which patterns should be played in loopmode by default (every pattern plays in a certain number of loops), so if a pattern is supposed to loop for a while, it requires good coordination across both devices.

Overall, I was very pleased with this setup and the sound quality - I made every sound from scratch for the first time.
Except for the short intro, the songs themselves weren't really my cup of tea though, I have to cut things back a little more. My next goal is to work on the integration of both devices into a Daw environment using the Overbridge vst. This way, I can use Ableton Live as a mixer to improve the sound, play samples and do all kinds of crazy fx mangling
