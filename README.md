# Making-Waves-Retrospective

The Making Waves workshop series introduced students to generative compositional techniques in the context of live performance.
Each session opened with a short theoretical introduction, followed by practical demonstrations and an open session in which the students could incorporate their learnings into their final performance.

For my performance, I used a dawless setup consisting of an Elektron Syntakt 12 track mono-synth and a Digitone FM 4 track poly-synth. I ran the Digitone into the Syntakt's inputs to make use of it's analog fx track and to fade in a new track with the digitone master gain.

The data structure of both devices can be described as Project>Songs>Patterns>Tracks>Sounds.
With the recent addition of songmode, I could easily queue songs/patterns and jump in and out of prerecorded sequences, which gave me the mix of structure and improvisation that I was looking for.
However, as of now, it is not possible to to preassign which patterns should be played in loopmode by default (every pattern plays in a certain number of loops), so if a pattern is supposed to loop for a while, it requires good coordination across both devices.

Overall, I was very pleased with this setup and the sound quality - I made every sound from scratch for the first time.
Except for the short intro, the songs themselves weren't really my cup of tea though, I have to cut things back a little more. My next goal is to work on the integration of both devices into a Daw environment using the Overbridge vst. This way, I can use Ableton Live as a mixer to improve the sound, play samples and do all kinds of crazy fx mangling

## Stefan

For his setup Stefan PÃ¼st, went dawless as well, connecting his Roland TR 707 to his Octatrack. 
Stefan combined multiple prerecorded instrument loops on his TR 707 into full arrangements. He would mute, fade in/out and swap individual loops to create an overarching structure. His Octatrack was mainly used to play prepared transition effects. The patterns of the Octatrack contained effects automations, such as filter sweeps. Stefan used the A/B fader of the Octatrack as his Dry/Wet control to switch to the effect-mangled version of his track at the right moment.
