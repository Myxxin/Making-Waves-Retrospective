# Making-Waves-Retrospective

The Making Waves workshop series aimed to introduce students to generative compositional techniques in the context of live performance. Each session began with a brief theoretical introduction, followed by practical demonstrations and an open session for students to apply what they had learned to their final performance.

During the final performances, students from diverse backgrounds had the opportunity to showcase their existing work, collaborate on a unified audio-visual piece, or perform their own 15-minute live set. The open workshop format allowed students to design their individual setups based on their unique artistic goals and needs, while also giving the workshop room to grow and refine its focus over time.

## Session One - Inspiration and Exploration

The first session of the workshop aimed to provide visual inspiration and an overview of the available musical tools to the students. After introducing the concept of generative algorithms and their ability to create data similar to existing data, the students were given local installations of the Stable Diffusion image generation AI. They explored the power of this particular generative model and created potential mood boards for their future performances

However, the technical introduction to the inner workings of AI went over the heads of most students, including the creative technologists. As a result, AI was not further utilized in the course.

During the second half of the workshop, the students had the opportunity to explore the musical devices of the Creative Technologies program with the guidance of the lecturers. This part of the session was well-received and included the following devices:

* MPC LIVE II
* Elektron Digitone
* Roland MC 707
* Multiple Korg Volcas
* Synthstrom Deluge
* Korg Minilogue
* Critter & Guitari Organelle

## Session Two - Sound Synthesis

The goal of session two was to give the students a solid understanding of sound synthesis fundamentals, as well as to encourage them to experiment with more leftfield methods as well. The first presentation by Marco Winter focused largely on subtractive synthesis, demonstrated with the [Ableton Wavetable synthesizer](https://www.ableton.com/de/packs/wavetable/).

Lara's session on her own work, influences and techniques took a different approach, hightlighting granular synthesis using orchestral samples as an alternative, more explorative way of creating sounds.

## Session Three

As a break from the two previous music-focused session, the focus of this session was on creating visuals to go alongside the final performances.
To get to know each other further, the students presented songs that inspire them and created a [shared playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7loq1NhkBNZHofEJ2ye6yU?si=9ad230fdd12c4b2c).

After the warmup, Rita introduced the class to the incredible VJing software resolume, which Giula used to create the following clip:


## Session Four

Session four ventured more deeply into the generative capabilities of Ableton Live and Max Msp/Max for Live. 
The focus fot the first part were generative techniques built into Ableton Live, such as follwing action, midi probability and lfo-driven sound design.
The second part of the theoretical session was led by Justin Robinson, who presented his generative instrument Pärtinator in addition to an overview of the Max MSP visual programming environment.

For my performance, I used a dawless setup consisting of an Elektron Syntakt 12 track mono-synth and a Digitone FM 4 track poly-synth. I ran the Digitone into the Syntakt's inputs to make use of it's analog fx track and to fade in a new track with the digitone master gain.

The data structure of both devices can be described as Project>Songs>Patterns>Tracks>Sounds.
With the recent addition of songmode, I could easily queue songs/patterns and jump in and out of prerecorded sequences, which gave me the mix of structure and improvisation that I was looking for.
However, as of now, it is not possible to to preassign which patterns should be played in loopmode by default (every pattern plays in a certain number of loops), so if a pattern is supposed to loop for a while, it requires good coordination across both devices.

Overall, I was very pleased with this setup and the sound quality - I made every sound from scratch for the first time.
Except for the short intro, the songs themselves weren't really my cup of tea though, I have to cut things back a little more. My next goal is to work on the integration of both devices into a Daw environment using the Overbridge vst. This way, I can use Ableton Live as a mixer to improve the sound, play samples and do all kinds of crazy fx mangling

## Stefan

For his setup Stefan Püst, went dawless as well, connecting his Roland TR 707 to his Octatrack. 
Stefan combined multiple prerecorded instrument loops on his TR 707 into full arrangements. He would mute, fade in/out and swap individual loops to create an overarching structure. His Octatrack was mainly used to play prepared transition effects. The patterns of the Octatrack contained effects automations, such as filter sweeps. Stefan used the A/B fader of the Octatrack as his Dry/Wet control to switch to the effect-mangled version of his track at the right moment.
